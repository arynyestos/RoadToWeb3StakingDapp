# Decentralized Staking dApp

This is Alchemy's Road to Web 3 [week 6](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-build-a-staking-dapp) project, which is a simplification of Speed Run Ethereum's [first challenge](https://speedrunethereum.com/challenge/decentralized-staking). Here we learnt about Scaffold ETH and created a staking dApp in which the user can lock their funds and receive a reward for it. It is worth noting that the project was explained using Scaffold ETH version 1, which has been deprecated since, so we used Scaffold ETH version 2. Take a look at the [staker](https://github.com/arynyestos/RoadToWeb3StakingDapp/blob/main/packages/hardhat/contracts/Staker.sol) smart contract, as well as the UI in the screenshot below!
